# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

9 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Set the quality bar | `/constraints` | Decide it once, enforce it everywhere |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Audit web performance | `/webperf` | Measure before you optimize |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Want fewer manual steps once the spec exists? **`/build auto`** generates the plan and implements every task in a single approved pass — you approve the plan once, then it runs autonomously. It removes the human stepping *between* tasks, not the verification: every task is still test-driven and committed individually, and it pauses on failures or risky steps.

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## Quick Start

**Fastest path — any agent, one command.** The open [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs into 70+ agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, and more):

```bash
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills # install all 25 skills
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --list # browse before installing
```

Or grab individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill code-review-and-quality # five-axis review before merge
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill interview-me # requirements interrogation, one question at a time
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill test-driven-development # red-green-refactor, enforced
```

> **Installing one skill?** A per-skill `npx` install copies only
> `skills/ /`, not the repo-level `references/` directory. The skill still
> works, but paths to supplementary shared checklists are unavailable. Use a
> whole-repo integration, clone the repository, or copy the needed checklist into
> a `references/` directory inside the installed skill. This portability gap is
> tracked in [#361](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills/issues/361).

 Claude Code (recommended) 

**Marketplace install:**

```
/plugin marketplace add addyosmani/agent-skills
/plugin install agent-skills@addy-agent-skills
```

> **SSH errors?** The marketplace clones repos via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up on GitHub, either [add your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or use the full HTTPS URL to force HTTPS cloning during the marketplace-add step:
> ```bash
> /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
> /plugin install agent-skills@addy-agent-skills
> ```
>
> If `/plugin install` still fails with `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)` on Windows or macOS, the recommended workaround is to configure Git once to rewrite GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS for subprocess clones:
> ```bash
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
> ```

**Local / development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/agent-skills
```

 Cursor 

Put workflow skills under `.cursor/skills/` (sync from `agent-skills/skills/`) and short policies in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — do not paste full skills into rules. See [docs/cursor-setup.md](docs/cursor-setup.md).

 Antigravity CLI 

Install as a native plugin for skills and subagents. In affected Antigravity CLI releases, legacy command TOMLs are reported as converted but their wrapper commands are not discoverable; invoke the underlying namespaced skills directly. See [docs/antigravity-setup.md](docs/antigravity-setup.md#lifecycle-workflows-and-command-compatibility).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
agy plugin install ./agent-skills
```

 Gemini CLI 

Install as native skills for auto-discovery, or add to `GEMINI.md` for persistent context. See [docs/gemini-cli-setup.md](docs/gemini-cli-setup.md).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git --path skills
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
gemini skills install ./agent-skills/skills/
```

 Windsurf 

Add skill contents to your Windsurf rules configuration. See [docs/windsurf-setup.md](docs/windsurf-setup.md).

 OpenCode 

Copy skills to `.opencode/skills/` (or `~/.config/opencode/skills/`), add a project-local `AGENTS.md`, and use the built-in `skill` tool for agent-driven execution. Optional slash commands can be added under `.opencode/commands/`.

See [docs/opencode-setup.md](docs/opencode-setup.md).

 GitHub Copilot 

Use agent definitions from `agents/` as Copilot personas and skill content in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. See [docs/copilot
