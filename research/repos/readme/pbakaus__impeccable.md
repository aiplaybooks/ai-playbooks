# Impeccable

Design guidance for AI coding agents. 1 skill, 24 commands, live browser iteration, and 60 deterministic detector rules for AI-generated frontend design.

> **Quick start:** From your project root, run `npx impeccable install`, then run `/impeccable init` inside your AI coding tool. Full docs: [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style).

## Why Impeccable?

Anthropic's [frontend-design](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/frontend-design) was the first widely-used design skill for Claude. Impeccable started from there.

Every model trained on the same SaaS templates. Skip the guidance and you get the same handful of tells on every project: Inter for everything, purple-to-blue gradients, cards nested in cards, gray text on colored backgrounds, the rounded-square icon tile above every heading.

Impeccable adds:
- **One setup flow.** `/impeccable init` records durable product truth in `PRODUCT.md`, so later commands know the audience, purpose, operating context, constraints, voice, and evidence without confusing those facts with surface-level visual direction.
- **24 commands.** A shared design vocabulary with your AI: `polish`, `audit`, `critique`, `distill`, `animate`, `bolder`, `quieter`, and more.
- **60 deterministic detector rules** plus LLM-only critique checks. The CLI and browser extension run the deterministic rules with no LLM and no API key.

## What's Included

### The Skill: impeccable

The skill installs as one command:

```bash
/impeccable 
```

Start every new project with:

```bash
/impeccable init
```

`init` inspects the project, asks only for material gaps in durable product truth, and writes `PRODUCT.md`. Visitor mode and visual direction are chosen later for each surface; incumbent or newly built visual systems are recorded separately in `DESIGN.md`.

### 24 Commands

All commands are accessed through `/impeccable`:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/impeccable craft` | Full shape-then-build flow with visual iteration |
| `/impeccable init` | One-time setup: gather durable product context, write PRODUCT.md, configure live mode when applicable, recommend next steps |
| `/impeccable document` | Generate root DESIGN.md from existing project code |
| `/impeccable extract` | Pull reusable components and tokens into the design system |
| `/impeccable shape` | Plan UX/UI before writing code |
| `/impeccable critique` | UX design review: hierarchy, clarity, emotional resonance |
| `/impeccable audit` | Run technical quality checks (a11y, performance, responsive) |
| `/impeccable polish` | Final pass, design system alignment, and shipping readiness |
| `/impeccable bolder` | Amplify boring designs |
| `/impeccable quieter` | Tone down overly bold designs |
| `/impeccable distill` | Strip to essence |
| `/impeccable harden` | Error handling, i18n, text overflow, edge cases |
| `/impeccable onboard` | First-run flows, empty states, activation paths |
| `/impeccable animate` | Add purposeful motion |
| `/impeccable colorize` | Introduce strategic color |
| `/impeccable typeset` | Fix font choices, hierarchy, sizing |
| `/impeccable layout` | Fix layout, spacing, visual rhythm |
| `/impeccable delight` | Add moments of joy |
| `/impeccable overdrive` | Add technically extraordinary effects |
| `/impeccable clarify` | Improve unclear UX copy |
| `/impeccable adapt` | Adapt for different devices |
| `/impeccable optimize` | Performance improvements |
| `/impeccable live` | Visual variant mode: iterate on elements in the browser |
| `/impeccable generate` | Generate variants of a named element in the live browser, no manual picking |

Use `/impeccable pin ` to create standalone shortcuts (e.g., `pin audit` creates `/audit`).

#### Usage Examples

```
/impeccable audit blog # Audit blog hub + post pages
/impeccable critique landing # UX design review
/impeccable polish settings # Final pass before shipping
/impeccable harden checkout # Add error handling + edge cases
```

Or use `/impeccable` directly with a description:
```
/impeccable redo this hero section
```

### Anti-Patterns

The skill includes explicit guidance on what to avoid:

- Don't use overused fonts (Arial, Inter, system defaults)
- Don't use gray text on colored backgrounds
- Don't use pure black/gray (always tint)
- Don't wrap everything in cards or nest cards inside cards
- Don't use bounce/elastic easing (feels dated)

## Installation

The skill needs no runtime of its own. Every skill copy ships a small launcher (`scripts/impeccable`, plus `impeccable.cmd` for Windows) that runs the Impeccable engine, a self-contained binary that either sits next to the launcher or is downloaded once on first run into `~/.impeccable/bin/`. Node is only involved if you use the `npx impeccable` installer, which is a shim around the same binary; the manual and Git options below work without it.

### Option 1: CLI installer (Recommended)

From the root of your project, run:

```bash
npx impeccable install
```

This shows the harness folders or installed CLIs it detected (for example `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.grok`, `~/.hermes`, `~/.veto`, or project-local `.cursor`), lets you keep the detected set or customize providers, then asks whether to install into the current project or globally. Use `--providers=claude,codex,cursor,grok,hermes,veto` and `--scope=project|global` to skip those choices in scripts. On Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Grok Build, it also installs the provider-native hook manifest for the current project. Veto receives the packaged skill under `~/.veto/skills/` and does not run native Impeccable edit hooks. Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Grok Build, Hermes Agent, Veto, and every other supported tool. Reload your harness afterward.
