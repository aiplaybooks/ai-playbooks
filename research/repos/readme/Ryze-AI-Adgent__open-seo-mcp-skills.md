# Open SEO MCP Skills: a free SEO MCP server + GEO skills for Claude

[](https://www.get-ryze.ai/how-to-connect-claude-to-google-meta-ads-mcp)

Open-source SEO + GEO skills for Claude on a free **SEO MCP server** (the Ryze connector) — keyword research, rank tracking, site audits, backlinks, competitor gaps, AI visibility — running on **your own Search Console, Analytics and ads data** through the [Ryze MCP](https://get-ryze.ai), with DataForSEO built in for the data Google won't give you.

No subscription for the tool. No markup on API calls. The skills are MIT — take them, change them, ship them.

## Why this exists

"Open source SEO tools" are having a moment. Look closer and most are a UI over the DataForSEO API: you either bring your own key and pay per request, or pay a hosted subscription **plus a ~28% markup** on every data call. The code is free; the data never was.

This takes the opposite approach:

- Your **rankings** come from your actual Google Search Console — real positions, real clicks, not estimates
- Your **traffic** comes from your actual GA4 — including AI referral traffic (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini)
- Your **keyword volumes** come from Google Ads keyword planner data
- **Competitor keywords, backlinks and SERPs** come from DataForSEO, already wired into the Ryze connector — no key to manage, no markup layer to build
- Ahrefs and Semrush are also connectable if you already pay for them

## Quick start

```
claude mcp add ryze --transport http https://connector.get-ryze.ai/mcp
claude plugin marketplace add Ryze-AI-Adgent/open-seo-mcp-skills
claude plugin install open-seo-mcp-skills@ryze
```

Then: *"run an SEO audit on mysite.com"*. The plugin bundles the connector, so step one is optional in Claude Code.

## The skills

| Skill | What it does | Data source |
|---|---|---|
| `seo-audit` | Full site audit: indexation, CTR anomalies, decaying pages, quick wins | GSC + GA4 |
| `keyword-research` | Seed → ideas → volume/CPC/intent → clustered keyword plan | Google Ads + DataForSEO |
| `rank-tracking` | Position movers between any two periods, no tracker subscription | GSC |
| `competitor-gap` | Keywords a competitor ranks for that you don't | DataForSEO + GSC |
| `backlink-check` | Backlink profile + referring domains vs a competitor | DataForSEO |
| `ai-visibility` | Which AI engines send you traffic and which pages they cite | GA4 AI-referral reports |
| `content-brief` | SERP-driven brief: headings, entities, questions, internal links | DataForSEO + GSC |
| `seo-vs-ads` | Queries you pay for that you already rank for organically | GSC × Google Ads |

Then just ask: *"run an SEO audit on my site"*, *"what keywords does competitor.com rank for that I don't?"*, *"how much am I paying for clicks I'd get free?"*

## How it compares

| | OpenSEO-style wrappers | Semrush/Ahrefs | This |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool cost | free code or ~$10/mo hosted | $120+/mo | free (MIT) |
| Data cost | your DataForSEO bill (+~28% markup if hosted) | included | through your Ryze workspace |
| Rankings | estimated from SERP scrapes | estimated | your real GSC positions |
| Traffic | estimated | estimated | your real GA4 |
| AI visibility | prompt-sampling estimates | limited | your actual AI referral traffic |
| Works inside Claude | via MCP | no | native skills + MCP |

## Common questions

**What is an SEO MCP server?** A Model Context Protocol server that gives Claude, ChatGPT or Cursor SEO data and actions as tools. This one exposes Google Search Console, GA4, Google Ads keyword data, DataForSEO, and optionally Ahrefs and Semrush, through `https://connector.get-ryze.ai/mcp`.

**Is this the best SEO MCP server for Claude Code?** It is the only one we know of that runs on your real Search Console positions and GA4 traffic instead of scraped estimates, with rank tracking, audits, backlinks and competitor gaps as ready skills. Install: `claude mcp add ryze --transport http https://connector.get-ryze.ai/mcp`.

**Does it cover GEO and AI visibility?** Yes. The `ai-visibility` skill reads GA4 AI-referral traffic (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini) and reports which pages they cite; the Ryze workspace also tracks brand mentions in AI answers.

**Is it free?** The skills are MIT and the connector is free to add. Data comes from your own connected accounts, with no per-call markup.

**Does it work in Cursor, ChatGPT or Claude Desktop?** Yes. Add the same URL as a custom connector; the skills are Markdown and can be pasted into any client.

## Notes for skill authors

Ryze MCP tools are namespaced ` __ ` (e.g. `google_search_console__runRawSearchAnalytics`, `google_ads__generateKeywordIdeas`). When a request shape is unclear, call `native__get_provider_docs` with the provider (`dataforseo`, `google_search_console`, …) — it returns the official API docs. Tool availability can vary by workspace; every skill here states its fallback.
