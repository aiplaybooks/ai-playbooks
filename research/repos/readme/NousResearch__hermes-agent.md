# Hermes Agent ☤

 Hermes Agent | Hermes Desktop 

**The self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), OpenRouter, OpenAI, your own endpoint, and [many others](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/integrations/providers). Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

 A real terminal interface Full TUI with multiline editing, slash-command autocomplete, conversation history, interrupt-and-redirect, and streaming tool output. 
 Lives where you do Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, and CLI — all from a single gateway process. Voice memo transcription, cross-platform conversation continuity. 
 A closed learning loop Agent-curated memory with periodic nudges. Autonomous skill creation after complex tasks. Skills self-improve during use. FTS5 session search with LLM summarization for cross-session recall. Honcho dialectic user modeling. Compatible with the agentskills.io open standard. 
 Scheduled automations Built-in cron scheduler with delivery to any platform. Daily reports, nightly backups, weekly audits — all in natural language, running unattended. 
 Delegates and parallelizes Spawn isolated subagents for parallel workstreams. Write Python scripts that call tools via RPC, collapsing multi-step pipelines into zero-context-cost turns. 
 Runs anywhere, not just your laptop Seven terminal backends — local, Docker, SSH, Singularity, Modal, Daytona, and Vercel Sandbox. Daytona and Modal offer serverless persistence — your agent's environment hibernates when idle and wakes on demand, costing nearly nothing between sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS or a GPU cluster. 
 Research-ready Batch trajectory generation, trajectory compression for training the next generation of tool-calling models.

## Quick Install

### Linux, macOS, WSL2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

> **Heads up:** Native Windows runs Hermes without WSL — CLI, gateway, TUI, and tools all work natively. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS one-liner above works there too. Found a bug? Please [file issues](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues).

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1)
```

The source installer delegates Python 3.14, Node.js, npm, ripgrep, FFmpeg,
and Python dependencies to PM. If Git is absent, it stages the verified Git
for Windows archive in Hermes' tool store. It does not replace your system Git.
See [installation methods](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/installation)
for the separate MSIX/App Installer package and its update ownership.

> **Android / Termux:** A signed APT repository is available for aarch64 devices, with a `stable` channel (tagged releases) and a prerelease `canary` channel. The package includes Python, Node.js, and the TUI. Use the [Termux guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux), not the desktop/server installer script.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is fully supported — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; WSL2 installs under `~/.hermes` as on Linux.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
hermes # start chatting!
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Windows Defender or antivirus flags `uv.exe` as malware

If your antivirus (Bitdefender, Windows Defender, etc.) quarantines `uv.exe` from the Hermes `bin` folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\bin\uv.exe`), this is a **false positive**. The file is Astral's `uv` — the Rust Python package manager Hermes bundles to manage its Python environment. ML-based antivirus engines commonly flag unsigned Rust binaries that download and install packages.

**To verify your copy is authentic:**

```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Run verification
$uv = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\bin\uv.exe"
$ver = (& $uv --version).Split(' ')[1]
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
$zip = "$env:TEMP\uv.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/$ver/uv-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip" -OutFile $zip -UseBasicParsing
gh attestation verify $zip --repo astral-sh/uv
Expand-Archive $zip "$env:TEMP\uv_x" -Force
(Get-FileHash "$env:TEMP\uv_x\uv.exe").Hash -eq (Get-FileHash $uv).Hash
```

If attestation says "Verification succeeded" and the last line prints `True`, you're good.

**To whitelist Hermes:**
- **Windows Defender:** Run PowerShell as Admin → `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\bin"`
- **Bitdefender:** Add an exception in the Bitdefender console (Protection > Antivirus > Settings > Manage Exceptions)
- Whitelist the **folder**, not the file hash — Hermes updates `uv` and the hash changes every version
