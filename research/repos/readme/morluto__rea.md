See a feature in an app that you want in your own product? Ask your agent to investigate it with REA. It can inspect the app without its source code, explain how the feature works, show the evidence, and build a version for your project.

REA connects your agent to tools for inspecting native binaries, JavaScript and Electron apps, .NET assemblies, and websites. You can also use the same tools from your terminal. Analysis runs locally, and results include the evidence and limitations behind each conclusion.

Setup registers REA with your agent and installs matching workflow instructions. Native analysis can use an existing Hopper, Ghidra, or IDA installation; setup can optionally install Hopper with approval. Static JavaScript analysis needs no native analysis engine.

> **[Visit the REA website](https://rea.tools/)** for setup instructions, illustrated guides, and real case studies.

## Quick start

On Linux, Ghidra, JADX, firmware tool launches and static JavaScript/Electron
analysis require a procps-compatible `ps` on REA's `PATH` for process ownership
checks. Recovery steps are in `docs/installation.md` under
"Linux owned-process prerequisite".

### Set up your agent

With Node.js and npm installed, run:

```bash
npx rea-agents setup
```

Choose your agents, review the proposed changes, and approve them. Setup adds
REA's MCP server and matching workflow instructions, with backups of existing
configuration. Restart your agent afterward.

Setup supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Grok Build and
[other agents](docs/installation.md#supported-agents). See
[installation and setup](docs/installation.md) for provider configuration and
manual MCP registration.

### Ask your agent

```text
Understand how search works in the Notes app, show me the evidence, and build a
similar feature for my project.
```

Replace Notes with your target app and the feature you want to understand.

### Use the terminal

Inspect an extracted JavaScript/Electron app directory or ASAR:

```bash
npx -y rea-agents@latest analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

The result includes modules, imports, Electron boundaries and their evidence.
Replace the path with your target, such as `"D:/apps/example"` on Windows.

To install the `rea` command for regular use:

```bash
npm install --global rea-agents
rea --help
```

For native analysis, configure a provider first. See the
[CLI and Evidence guide](docs/cli.md) for native commands, provider selection,
snapshots and scripting.

### Update REA

REA changes quickly, and new releases include frequent bug fixes. Keep your
installation up to date.

For a CLI installed with `npm install --global` or `bun add --global`:

```bash
rea update
```

Bun global updates require Bun 1.2.17 or later. With an older Bun release,
upgrade Bun manually before running `rea update`.

To refresh your agent registrations and skill, run the setup command printed
by the update.

If you use `npx`, update your agent setup with:

```bash
npx rea-agents@latest setup
```

Review the setup changes and restart your agent. For one-off CLI commands,
use `npx rea-agents@latest` followed by the command. With Bun, use
`bunx rea-agents@latest` in place of `npx rea-agents@latest`.

## How REA works

Your agent calls REA through MCP to inspect the target and trace relevant code.
REA returns findings with their evidence. The agent uses them to ask follow-up
questions, explain the behavior, or write and test an implementation.
CLI commands use the same workflows.

## What you can analyze

REA requires Node.js 22.x (>=22.19), 24.x (>=24.11), or 26+, plus npm.
Additional tools and host support depend on the target:
