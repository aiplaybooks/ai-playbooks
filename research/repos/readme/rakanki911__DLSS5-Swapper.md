## Features

- **Easy installation:** native DLSS games, or compatible non-DLSS games through DLSS5-Feeder.
- **Your library:** Steam, Epic, GOG, modern Xbox Game Pass folders, and manually added games/emulators.
- **Search and filters:** combine title, graphics API, DLSS status/version and add-ons; click counters to filter.
- **Flexible layout:** group by store or show everything in one list, with game artwork and light/dark themes.
- **Controlled scanning:** full-drive scanning is **off by default**. Added folders still scan normally; enable all-drive discovery or remove scan folders in Settings.
- **Right-click shortcuts:** open/copy folder, rescan, change cover, restore originals or hide a game.
- **Backups and History:** restore original files, keep installation records, and copy History/activity/install logs.
- **Save diagnostics:** one file with the install log, the game’s own ReShade and Feeder logs, the manifest and your driver - shown to you before it is written, and ready to attach to a report.
- **In-game overlay:** press **F8** to open the app's own panel over the running game and move the real DLSS Neural Rendering sliders while you play. Supports the **DLSS5-Feeder** and **RenoDX v4.7** routes only. Drag the grip in its bottom right corner to resize it; each game remembers its own size.
- **Rendering API override:** optional, per game, with **Automatic** as the default; detection is never overwritten.
- **Custom add-ons:** the Add-ons page remains available alongside the integrated installation routes.
- **Multipass neural rendering:** an installation route that runs the neural pass up to ten times per frame, on DX12, DX11 and 64-bit DX9 - including games with no DLSS of their own.
- **Community (BETA):** read what worked for other people, narrowed to the games on your PC and the graphics card in it, leave your own report, and talk it over underneath it. Opt-in, and everything you leave can be edited, deleted or withdrawn.
- **Community chat:** one live room for everyone using the app - screenshots, game cards, replies with mentions and reactions.

## New in 2.2.7

Find the reviews that matter to you, hear about it when people answer you - and every fix promised on the tracker.

### ✨ New

**1 · Filter by your graphics card** - pick your card in the Community filter and see only the reviews from people with that same card. Your own card is always the first choice.

**2 · Only the reviews from your card** - open any game with the filter on, and it starts on what people with your card found. Everyone else is one click away.

**3 · Reviews for your games** - switch to **My games** and the page shows only the games installed on your PC, tagged when DLSS 5 is already in them.

**4 · See it before you install** - open any game in your library: what the community found for it is right above the install button.

Also new: **My comments** (everything you reported, in one place), **Sort** by most recent, most reports or A-Z, API tags on every card ([#288]), and **notifications** when someone mentions you in the chat, replies to you there, or reacts to your review or your message.

### 🔧 Fixed

| | |
|---|---|
| **DirectDraw never installed** | dgVoodoo was downloaded only for DX8 and DX9, so every DirectDraw game failed with `errDgVoodooMissing` - Gens and the other emulators included ([#292], [#279], [#150]) |
| **Prey, Titanfall 2, Call of Duty 2 and Max Payne read as "No 3D executable"** | Their renderer is a DLL beside the executable. A Direct3D library in the executable's own folder is now enough to offer it ([#259], [#249]) |
| **Portal was filed under Half-Life 2** | Both run `hl2.exe`, and no report ever carried the store id it should have. An executable many games share - `hl2.exe`, every emulator - no longer decides which card a report lands on ([#274]) |
| **The read-only ReShade.ini banner came back** | 2.2.5 cleared it only when a game was opened in the app. Every game this app installed into is checked once each time it starts ([#155]) |
| **Games under Program Files failed with `EPERM`** | Windows protects that folder. The install now says so up front, in words: run as administrator, or move the game ([#301]) |
| **The driver warning read like a wall** | It is a warning: many people run newer drivers without trouble, especially with MSI Afterburner and RivaTuner closed. It says so now ([#300], [#278]) |
| **"DLSS was installed normally" before it was** | The overlay message appeared before the install finished, even when it then failed ([#275]) |
| **Uninstalling left ReShade in games** | Uninstalling never touches game folders. The uninstaller now says so and points to **Restore originals** first ([#266]) |
