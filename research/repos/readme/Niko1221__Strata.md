Strata runs **[Qwen3.8-Flash-Next](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)** - a large, smart AI model that
normally needs a server - on a normal PC. It chats, writes code, reads pictures and works with your apps and coding
agents, and nothing leaves your PC.

## How fast is it?

Measured on two ordinary gaming PCs. "Writes answers" is how fast the reply appears in a short chat; "reads your
prompt" is how fast it takes in what you send (a 32K-token document, code or chat history). A token is about ¾ of a
word, so 60 tokens per second is faster than you can read.

 NVIDIA: RTX 5070 (12 GB), Ryzen 5 7600, 64 GB RAM AMD: RX 9070 XT (16 GB), Ryzen 9 3900X, 47 GB RAM 

| Size | Writes answers | Reads your prompt |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 93 tokens/s | 2,170 tokens/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 79 tokens/s | 2,090 tokens/s |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 62 tokens/s | 1,750 tokens/s |
| **IQ3_S** | 53 tokens/s | 1,620 tokens/s |
| **Coder** | 55 tokens/s | 2,180 tokens/s |

| Size | Writes answers | Reads your prompt |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 60 tokens/s | 1,160 tokens/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 52 tokens/s | 1,110 tokens/s |
| **Coder** | 44 tokens/s | 1,420 tokens/s |

A card with more VRAM is faster: an RTX 3090 (24 GB) should write roughly 100-140 tokens per second. Long chats,
other cards: [speed of each model](docs/MODELS.md#how-fast-is-each-size), [community results](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md).

 Strata is free. If it runs well on your PC, a coffee keeps the work on it going. 

## What you need

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Graphics card** | **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20, 30, 40 or 50 series, or **AMD** Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX, RX 7800 XT / 7700 XT, RX 9060 XT, RX 9070 / 9070 XT, Radeon AI PRO R9700 or RX 6800 / 6900 series - with **12 GB of VRAM or more** |
| **RAM** | 32 GB or more - how much decides [which model](#which-model-should-i-pick) fits; 64 GB runs every size |
| **Disk** | about 80 GB free, on an SSD if you can (the first start is much faster) |
| **System** | Windows 10 / 11 or Linux, and a current graphics driver from NVIDIA or AMD |

Everything else is installed for you. Two or three cards can share the model ([multi-GPU](docs/MULTI_GPU.md)).
The full list: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#what-you-need).

## Install

### Let your AI set it up

Use an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, ...)? Paste this into it:

```text
Set up Strata on this PC for me: https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata - follow docs/AI_SETUP.md in that repository.
```

It checks your graphics card, RAM and disk, picks the model that fits, installs it, starts it and tells you how to
connect your apps. AI tools can also install, start and stop Strata themselves through its
[MCP server](docs/MCP_SERVER.md).

### Or do it yourself

[Download Strata](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (or `git clone` it).
**Windows:** double-click **`START-HERE.bat`**. **Linux:** run **`./setup.sh`** in the Strata folder.

The same steps for NVIDIA and AMD: the installer finds your card and sets up the right engine for it. It asks which
model, which size, how much context (how much text it keeps in mind) and whether it should read pictures - press
Enter each time for the recommended answer. Then it downloads the model (~70 GB; you can stop and it continues where
it left off) and starts it. Your browser opens the Strata app at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

> **While the model starts, your PC can be slow or stop responding for 1-3 minutes** (longest the first time): Strata
> loads 35-55 GB into your RAM and locks part of it for the graphics card. That's normal - wait, and don't close the
> window. The window tells you what it is doing.

**Next time**, run `START-HERE.bat` (or `./setup.sh`) again: it starts right away, nothing is downloaded twice. Close
its window to stop the model. Updating, Docker, several cards, where the files go and every option:
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Which model should I pick?

The installer recommends one for your RAM. The same model comes in sizes that are compressed more or less: smaller
is faster, larger is a bit smarter.

| Your RAM | Take | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **32 GB** | **Coder** | it fits 32 GB, and it is made for code (with a 24 GB card, Q2_0 and IQ2_XS run too) |
| **48 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (or Q2_0, the fastest) | the larger sizes do not fit |
| **64 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (recommended), or IQ3_XXS / IQ3_S | every size fits; IQ3_S is the best, and the slowest |
| **96 GB or more** | **IQ3_S**, or Unsloth's 4-bit (experimental) | room for the largest sizes with everything else open |

- **[Coder](docs/MODELS.md#coder)** - a coding version with half of the experts removed: 91% of the full model's
 SWE-bench Verified score (by its authors), fits 32 GB of RAM. Weaker outside coding.
- **[Swift 1.5](docs/MODELS.md#swift-15)** - a fine-tune that thinks much shorter before it answers, so you get the
 answer sooner, at about the same quality.
- **[Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL](docs/MODELS.md#unsloth-ud-q4_k_xl-experimental)** (experimental) - the closest to the full
 model, but most of it is read from the SSD while it answers: 7-8.5 tokens/s on a 64 GB PC.
- **[OrcaRouter's Uncensored IQ3_XXS](docs/MODELS.md#orcarouter-uncensored-iq3_xxs)** - a manual setup, not in the
 installer's menu.

Sizes, downloads and what fits where: [docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md). You can add another model later with
`SETUP.bat` (Linux: `./setup.sh --setup`).
