Strata runs **[Qwen3.8-Flash-Next](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)** on a normal PC. This is a
large, smart AI model that usually needs a server. It chats, writes code, reads pictures and works with your apps
and coding agents. Nothing leaves your PC.

## How fast is it?

We measured it on two ordinary gaming PCs. A token is about ¾ of a word.

- **Writes answers:** how fast the reply appears in a short chat. 60 tokens per second is faster than you can read.
- **Reads your prompt:** how fast it takes in what you send (here a 32K-token document, code or chat history).

 NVIDIA: RTX 5070 (12 GB), Ryzen 5 7600, 64 GB RAM AMD: RX 9070 XT (16 GB), Ryzen 9 3900X, 47 GB RAM 

| Size | Writes answers | Reads your prompt |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 94 tokens/s | 2,650 tokens/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 79 tokens/s | 2,090 tokens/s |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 62 tokens/s | 1,750 tokens/s |
| **IQ3_S** | 53 tokens/s | 1,620 tokens/s |
| **Coder** | 55 tokens/s | 2,180 tokens/s |

| Size | Writes answers | Reads your prompt |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 60 tokens/s | 1,160 tokens/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 52 tokens/s | 1,110 tokens/s |
| **Coder** | 44 tokens/s | 1,420 tokens/s |

NVIDIA: Q2_0 with engine 0.1.36, the other rows with 0.1.26 (4K answers, 32K prompts). The full tables are in
[DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md#speed-measured). A card with more VRAM is faster: an RTX 3090 (24 GB) should write
about 100-140 tokens per second. Long chats and other cards: [speed of each model](docs/MODELS.md#how-fast-is-each-size),
[community results](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md).

 Strata is free. If it runs well on your PC, a coffee keeps the work on it going. 

## What you need

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Graphics card** | **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20, 30, 40 or 50 series, or **AMD** Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX, RX 7800 XT / 7700 XT, RX 9060 XT, RX 9070 / 9070 XT, Radeon AI PRO R9700 or RX 6800 / 6900 series. It needs **12 GB of VRAM or more**. |
| **RAM** | 32 GB or more. Your RAM decides [which model](#which-model-should-i-pick) fits. 64 GB runs every size. |
| **Disk** | About 80 GB free. Use an SSD if you can: the first start is much faster. |
| **System** | Windows 10 / 11 or Linux, and a current graphics driver from NVIDIA or AMD. |

The installer sets up everything else. Two or three cards can share the model ([multi-GPU](docs/MULTI_GPU.md)).

Experimental, written and tested by community members on their own machines:

- **Older graphics cards** (Tesla P40 / V100, GTX 10, Radeon VII / MI50, RX 6700 XT, RX 5500 XT): [Older GPUs](docs/OLDER_GPUS.md).
- **Intel Arc**, built from source on Linux: [Intel Arc](docs/INTEL_ARC.md).
- **Older processors without AVX2**: they work, but slowly. [Older CPUs](docs/INSTALL.md#older-cpus-experimental).

The full list: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#what-you-need).

## Install

### Let your AI set it up

Do you use an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, ...)? Paste this into it:

```text
Set up Strata on this PC for me: https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata - follow docs/AI_SETUP.md in that repository.
```

It checks your graphics card, RAM and disk and picks the model that fits. Then it installs and starts it and tells
you how to connect your apps. AI tools can also install, start and stop Strata through its
[MCP server](docs/MCP_SERVER.md).

### Or do it yourself

[Download Strata](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (or `git clone` it).
**Windows:** double-click **`START-HERE.bat`**. **Linux:** run **`./setup.sh`** in the Strata folder.

The steps are the same for NVIDIA and AMD. The installer finds your card and sets up the right engine for it. It
asks you a few questions:

- which model and which size,
- how much context (how much text the model keeps in mind),
- whether it should read pictures.

Press Enter each time for the recommended answer. Then it downloads the model (about 70 GB) and starts it. If the
download stops, run it again: it continues where it left off. Your browser opens the Strata app at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

> **While the model starts, your PC can be slow or stop responding for 1-3 minutes** (longest the first time).
> Strata loads 35-55 GB into your RAM and locks part of it for the graphics card. This is normal. Wait, and don't
> close the window. The window shows what Strata is doing.

**Next time**, run `START-HERE.bat` (or `./setup.sh`) again. It starts right away and downloads nothing twice. Close
its window to stop the model. `UPDATE.bat` (`./update.sh`) updates Strata without starting it. Updating, Docker,
several cards, where the files go and every option: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Which model should I pick?

The installer recommends one for your RAM. The same model comes in several sizes, compressed more or less. Smaller
sizes are faster. Larger sizes are a bit smarter.

| Your RAM | Take | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **32 GB** | **Coder** | it fits 32 GB, and it is made for code (with a 24 GB card, Q2_0 and IQ2_XS run too) |
| **48 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (or Q2_0, the fastest) | the larger sizes do not fit |
| **64 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (recommended), or IQ3_XXS / IQ3_S | every size fits; IQ3_S is the best and the slowest |
| **96 GB or more** | **IQ3_S**, or Unsloth's UD-IQ4_XS (~4-bit) | room for the largest sizes with everything else open |
