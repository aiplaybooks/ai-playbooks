## About

Concat is a free, open-source video editor and a CapCut alternative for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android. It covers what people actually open CapCut for: auto-captions, text-to-speech, background removal, keyframe animation, effects and titles, multi-track cutting, 4K export. With none of the catches: no watermark, no account, no subscription, no upload.

Everything runs locally on a native Rust engine with a GPU compositor. Install it, drop in footage, cut. The AI models for captions, voices and cutout download once from Settings and work offline after that. Your footage never leaves your disk.

**Good for:** TikTok, Reels and Shorts, YouTube videos, tutorials and screen recordings, podcast clips, memes.

**Also for machines:** a JSON-RPC, gRPC and MCP API, so scripts and AI agents can cut video with it too.

## Highlights

## Download

Two ways in:

1. **[The website](https://concatenate.pages.dev/#download)** hands you the right build for your machine. Start here.
2. **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/releases)** has every build for every platform, with installers, packages and checksums. For when you want to pick.

Concat is in **beta**: it works, and it still has edges. [Say so](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/issues) when you find one.

**Platforms**

- ✅ **Windows** · x86_64 and ARM. A setup and an `.msi`. If SmartScreen stops an unsigned build: **More info** › **Run anyway**
- ✅ **macOS** · Intel and Apple silicon. If macOS refuses to open an unsigned build: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Concat.app`
- ✅ **Linux** · x86_64 and ARM. `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and an Arch package. Also a Flatpak on **[Flatpark](https://flatpark.org/apps/app.concat.editor/)**, a community Flatpak remote that wraps the x86_64 `.deb` of each release and updates with it
- ✅ **Android** · phones and tablets
- ✅ **iOS / iPadOS** · iPhone and iPad, sideloaded

✅ Supported · 🚧 Work in progress · 🧪 To be tested

**System requirements** and the optional model sizes are on [the website](https://concatenate.pages.dev/guides/system-requirements).

## Get started

Download it, open it, drop footage in, cut. No account, no setup.

**Reporting something:** every run writes a log, and Settings › About has the button that opens it along with the one that copies your system information. Attach both to an [issue](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/issues) and the report arrives with everything it needs. The last ten runs are kept, so yesterday's is still there; nothing is ever sent anywhere on its own.

## How to Contribute

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The best way to contribute is to grab a build from the [Releases](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/releases) page and use it: find where it breaks, and say where it could be better.
>
> Ready to write code? [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) covers setup, the layout of the tree, the checks to run, and how contributions are licensed. Driving Concat from a script, a service or an agent? [The developer docs](https://concatenate.pages.dev/docs) cover the Concat API and its transports: JSON-RPC, gRPC and MCP. [This Discussion](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/discussions/3) is where the project was announced.

## Sponsoring

Concat has no paywall and never will: no watermark, no account, no paid tier. Sponsoring is what stands in for one. If Concat has taken the place of a subscription for you, a fraction of that keeps it going.
